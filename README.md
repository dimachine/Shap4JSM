# Shap4JSM

This repository contains a demo code and data on Shapley values for JSM-method in terms of Concept Lattices (FCA) presented in the paper:

* [Dmitry I. Ignatov, Léonard Kwuida: Interpretable Concept-Based Classification with Shapley Values. ICCS 2020: 90-102](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-57855-8_7).

It also continues our work on interpretable contribution of attributes to concept stability values:

* [Dmitry I. Ignatov, Léonard Kwuida: Shapley and Banzhaf Vectors of a Formal Concept. CLA 2020: 259-271](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2668/paper20.pdf).


To acknowledge use of the code and data in publications, please cite the following papers and mention this repository.
